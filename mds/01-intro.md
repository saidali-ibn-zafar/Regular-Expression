# Regular Expression

- `Regular expressions` (regex) can indeed often be found between slashes `(/)` in many programming languages, especially in JavaScript. The `slashes /` indicate the start and end of the regex pattern.

- `i` - Case `insensitive`: Makes the match case-insensitive, allowing "a" to match both "a" and "A".
- `g` - `Global` search: Searches for all matches in the input string, rather than stopping after the first match.
- `m` - `Multiline`: Changes the behavior of ^ and $ anchors to match the start and end of a line, rather than the whole string.
- `s` - `Single line` (DotAll): Allows the dot (.) to match newline characters, which it normally does not.
- `u` - `Unicode`: Treats the pattern as a sequence of Unicode code points.
- `y` - `Sticky`: Searches for the match at the exact position indicated by the lastIndex property of the regex object.
